## What is it?

To make our vision possible we’re building a network cloud that you can take
anywhere, backed by open source. Key features to include:

- Traffic management with service chainning to offload Internet and app traffic
  and route securely in private, controlled paths to clouds, SaaS services or
  other destinations
- Flexible ways to bring traffic into the Datum Network Cloud, including
  authoritative DNS, built in global proxy / LB, DDoS filtering, GRE or IPSec
  tunnels and more
- Leverage Datum’s global managed cloud for data plane or bring your own cloud
  (BYOC) zones via a standard Kubernetes operator deploy model
- BYOC zones can be connected to the Datum Cloud control plane for DevOps,
  observability, authorization control and more
- Partner friendly model that supports deploy, manage and lifecycle of
  commercial and open source NFV technologies
- Commercial support for partner marketplace transactions that remove
  margin-stacking on 3rd party technology
- A reimagined interface and data model for private application and ecosystem
  interconnections
