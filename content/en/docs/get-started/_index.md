We're in the early stages of Datum, which means that you cannot yet experience much value as a user. Currently you can register for a Datum Cloud account and engage with our "Bring Your Own Cloud" provider to deploy resources at GCP.  In the coming weeks this will evolve and expand, so please check back for updates or stay tuned in our [Community Slack](https://slack.datum.net/).

{{< alert title="Disclaimer" color="warning">}}
The Datum platform is currently at a Preview stage and is not currently suitable
for production use cases.

## Account Registration

Sign up for an account at <https://cloud.datum.net>.

## Organizations

Datum manages resources within Organizations and Projects. When you sign up,
a personal organization is automatically created for you.

You may create additional organizations, which you can invite team members to
join.
