## Summary

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a development
environment to install and run the Datum Cloud operators. It is targeted toward
a technical audience familiar with Kubernetes, kubebuilder, and
controller-runtime.

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Install and configure the required dependencies.
- Set up kind clusters for "upstream" and "infra" control planes.
- Install and run the Workload Operator, Network Services Operator, and Infra
  Provider GCP components.
- Configure and use Config Connector for managing GCP resources.
- Register a Location and create a sample Workload in Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and properly configured:

- **Git**: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- **Golang**: [Installation Guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)
  - MUST be version 1.23 or greater.
- **Docker Desktop**: [Installation Guide](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- **Kubebuilder**: [Installation Guide](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation)
- **Kind**: [Installation Guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-with-a-package-manager)
- **kubectl**: [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- **gcloud**: [Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- **jq**: [Installation Guide](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)

### Troubleshooting

If errors such as `Command 'make' not found` are encountered, reference the
following guides for installing required build tools:

- [Preparing Your Local Operating System](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md#preparing-your-local-operating-system)
- [Installing Required Software](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/development.md#installing-required-software)

## Control Plane Setup

### Create Kind Clusters

1. Create an "upstream" control plane:

    ```shell
    kind create cluster --name upstream
    ```

2. Create an "infra" control plane:

    ```shell
    kind create cluster --name infra
    ```

## Install Third Party Operators

### cert-manager

Install cert-manager in the "upstream" control plane:

```shell
kubectl --context kind-upstream apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.yaml
```

Ensure that cert-manager pods are running and ready:

```shell
kubectl --context kind-upstream wait -n cert-manager \
  --for=condition=Ready pod --all
```

Output should be similar to the following:

```shell
pod/cert-manager-b6fd485d9-2s78z condition met
pod/cert-manager-cainjector-dcc5966bc-ntbw4 condition met
pod/cert-manager-webhook-dfb76c7bd-vxgb8 condition met
```

Refer to the [cert-manager installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/)
for more details.

### GCP Config Connector

GCP Config Connector is used to manage Google Cloud resources directly from
Kubernetes. The infra-provider-gcp application integrates with GCP Config
Connector to create and maintain resources in GCP based on Kubernetes custom
resources.

> [!TIP]
>
> The service account creation instructions in the installation guide result
> in granting significantly more access to the GCP project than necessary. It
> is recommended to only bind the following roles to the service account:
>
> - `roles/compute.admin`
> - `roles/container.admin`
> - `roles/secretmanager.admin`
> - `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
> - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!NOTE]
> The section "Specifying where to create your resources" can be skipped.

1. Set the kubectl context to `kind-infra` in order to target the correct control
   plane while following the Config Connector installation guide.

    ```shell
    kubectl config use-context kind-infra
    ```

2. Follow the [installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/how-to/install-other-kubernetes),
   making sure to retain the service account credential saved to `key.json`, as
   this will be required later by `infra-provider-gcp`.

3. Set the kubectl context back to `kind-upstream`.

    ```shell
    kubectl config use-context kind-upstream
    ```

## Datum Operator Installation

Clone the following repositories into the same parent folder for ease of use:

- [Workload Operator](https://github.com/datum-cloud/workload-operator/tree/integration/datum-poc)
- [Network Services Operator](https://github.com/datum-cloud/network-services-operator/tree/integration/datum-poc)
- [Infra Provider GCP](https://github.com/datum-cloud/infra-provider-gcp/tree/integration/datum-poc)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For each repository, change the working branch to `integration/datum-poc`
>
> ```shell
> git -C workload-operator checkout integration/datum-poc
> git -C network-services-operator checkout integration/datum-poc
> git -C infra-provider-gcp checkout integration/datum-poc
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the kubectl context is set to `kind-upstream` before executing these
> steps.
>
> ```shell
> kubectl config use-context kind-upstream
> ```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!NOTE]
> The `make` commands can take some time to execute for the first time.

### Workload Operator

1. In a separate terminal, navigate to the cloned `workload-operator` repository:

    ```shell
    cd /path/to/workload-operator
    ```

2. Install CRDs:

    ```shell
    make install
    ```

3. Start the operator:

    ```shell
    make run
    ```

### Network Services Operator

1. In a separate terminal, navigate to the cloned `network-services-operator` repository:

    ```shell
    cd /path/to/network-services-operator
    ```

2. Install CRDs:

    ```shell
    make install
    ```

3. Start the operator:

    ```shell
    make run
    ```

### Infra Provider GCP

1. In a separate terminal, navigate to the cloned `infra-provider-gcp` repository:

    ```shell
    cd /path/to/infra-provider-gcp
    ```

2. Create `infra.kubeconfig` and `upstream.kubeconfig` files pointing to the
   respective control planes.

    ```shell
    kind export kubeconfig --name upstream --kubeconfig upstream.kubeconfig
    kind export kubeconfig --name infra --kubeconfig infra.kubeconfig
    ```

3. Start the operator after ensuring that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
  environment variable is set to the path for the key saved while installing
  [GCP Config Connector](#gcp-config-connector).

    ```shell
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/key.json
    ```

    ```shell
    make run
    ```

## Deploying Resources

### Registering a Location

Before creating a workload, a Location must be registered. Use the following example manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.datumapis.com/v1alpha
kind: Location
metadata:
  name: my-gcp-us-south1-a
spec:
  locationClassName: self-managed
  topology:
    topology.datum.net/city-code: DFW
  provider:
    gcp:
      projectId: TODO
      region: us-south1
      zone: us-south1-a
```

1. Replace `topology.datum.net/city-code`'s value (`DFW`) with the desired city code for your workloads.
2. Update the `gcp` provider settings to reflect your GCP project ID, desired region, and zone.

Apply the manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f <path-to-location-manifest>
```

List Locations:

```shell
kubectl get locations
```

```shell
NAME                 AGE
my-gcp-us-south1-a   5s
```

### Creating a Network

Before creating a workload, a Network must be created. You can use the following
manifest to do this:

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, a default network may automatically be created in a namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.datumapis.com/v1alpha
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  ipam:
    mode: Auto
```

Apply the manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f <path-to-network-manifest>
```

List Networks:

```shell
kubectl get networks
```

```shell
NAME      AGE
default   5s
```

### Creating a Workload

> [!CAUTION]
> These actions will result in billable resources being created in the GCP
> project for the target location. Destroy any resources which are not needed
> to avoid unnecessary costs.

Create a manifest for a sandbox based workload, for example:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.datumapis.com/v1alpha
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: my-container-workload
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      runtime:
        resources:
          instanceType: datumcloud/d1-standard-2
        sandbox:
          containers:
            - name: httpbin
              image: mccutchen/go-httpbin
              ports:
                - name: http
                  port: 8080
      networkInterfaces:
        - network:
            name: default
          networkPolicy:
            ingress:
              - ports:
                - port: 8080
                from:
                  - ipBlock:
                      cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
  placements:
    - name: us
      cityCodes: ['DFW']
      scaleSettings:
        minReplicas: 1
```

Apply the manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f <path-to-workload-manifest>
```

#### Check the state of the workload

```shell
kubectl get workloads
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                    AGE   AVAILABLE   REASON
my-container-workload   9s    False       NoAvailablePlacements
```

The `REASON` field will be updated as the system progresses with attempting to
satisfy the workload's intent.

#### Check Workload Deployments

A Workload will result in one or more WorkloadDeployments being created, one for
each unique CityCode per placement.

```shell
kubectl get workloaddeployments
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                           AGE   LOCATION NAMESPCE   LOCATION NAME        AVAILABLE   REASON
my-container-workload-us-dfw   58s   default             my-gcp-us-south1-a   False       LocationAssigned
```

Similar to workloads, the `REASON` field will be updated as the system
progresses with attempting to satisfy the workload's intent. In this case, the
`infra-provider-gcp` operator is responsible for these actions.

#### Check Instances

```shell
kubectl -n default get instances -o wide
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                             AGE   AVAILABLE   REASON              NETWORK IP   EXTERNAL IP
my-container-workload-us-dfw-0   24s   True        InstanceIsRunning   10.128.0.2   34.174.154.114
```

Confirm that the go-httpbin application is running:

```shell
curl -s http://34.174.154.114:8080/uuid
```

```json
{
  "uuid": "8244205b-403e-4472-8b91-728245e99029"
}
```
